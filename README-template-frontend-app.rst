Purpose
=======

.. note::

   [TODO]

   What does this frontend app do?  Add a 2-3 sentence description of what it
   is and what it does.

This is the Awesome Frontend App.  It was built to provide an unmatched
learning experience, with improved tools for both randomized goodness and the
ability to directly reference amaze-blocks in existing courses. This experience
is powered by the new Fantastico storage engine.

Getting Started
===============

Developing with Tutor
---------------------

.. note::

   [TODO]

   If there are steps that deviate from the default Tutor setup, describe them
   here.

`Tutor`_ is recommended as the development environment for this frontend app.
You can refer to the `relevant tutor-mfe documentation`_ to get started using
it.

.. _Tutor: https://github.com/overhangio/tutor

.. _relevant tutor-mfe documentation: https://github.com/overhangio/tutor-mfe#mfe-development

Configuration
-------------

.. note::

   [TODO]

   Explicitly list anything that this app requires to function correctly.  This includes:

   * A list of both required and optional configuration variables, and how they
     each affect the functioning of the app

   * A list of edx-platform `feature and waffle flags`_ that are either
     required to enable use of this app, or affect the behavior of the app in
     some other way

   * A list of IDAs or other frontend apps that this app depends on to function
     correctly

.. _feature and waffle flags: https://docs.openedx.org/projects/openedx-proposals/en/latest/best-practices/oep-0017-bp-feature-toggles.html

Customization
=============

This frontend app can be customized using UI "slots".  The parts of this MFE
that can be customized in that manner are documented `here </src/slots>`_.

[PLACEHOLDER: Other Relevant Sections]
======================================

.. note::

   [TODO]

   This is optional, but you might have additional sections you wish to cover.
   For instance, architecture documentation, i18n notes, build process, or
   more.

Known Issues
============

.. note::

   [TODO]

   If there are long-standing known issues, list them here as a bulletted list,
   linking to the actual issues in the Github repository.

Development Roadmap
===================

.. note::

   [TODO]

   Include a list of current development targets, in (rough) descending order
   of priority.  It can be a simple bulleted list of roadmap items with links
   to Github issues or wiki pages.

Getting Help
============

.. note::

   [TODO]

   Use the following as a template, but feel free to add specific places where
   this app is commonly discussed.

If you're having trouble, we have discussion forums at
https://discuss.openedx.org where you can connect with others in the community.

Our real-time conversations are on Slack. You can request a `Slack
invitation`_, then join our `community Slack workspace`_.  Because this is a
frontend repository, the best place to discuss it would be in the `#wg-frontend
channel`_.

with as many details about the issue you are facing as you can provide.
